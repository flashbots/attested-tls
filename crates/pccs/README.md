# pccs

An internal Provisioning Certificate Caching Service implementation for DCAP
collateral fetching and caching.

This crate is used by attestation verification code that needs Intel TDX/SGX
collateral such as TCB info, QE identity, and certificate revocation lists.
It can:

- Fetch collateral from Intel PCS or a configured PCCS endpoint
- Cache collateral in-process
- Pre-warm the cache at startup
- Refresh cached collateral in the background before expiry

This is an alternative to Intel's reference PCCS server implementation which
can be embedded in Rust services that verify quotes.

For Intel's terminology and architecture, see the Intel documentation for the
[Provisioning Certificate Caching Service (PCCS)](https://cc-enabling.trustedservices.intel.com/intel-sgx-tdx-pccs/01/introduction/).

## Runtime Requirements

This crate expects to be used from within a Tokio runtime.

That applies even when calling synchronous-looking APIs such as
`get_collateral_sync()`: cache miss repair, proactive refresh, and startup
pre-warm are all driven by Tokio background tasks.
